# srsRAN-Quectel

Guide to setup to setup Host (5g core , srsRAN, controller) with Robot/Client (Quectel 5g modem, robot). We are able to cotroller a mini robot over a private 5g network.

## Host

Run the 5g core

Run the gNB stack

Connect the controller to the Host

Build gamepad_interface.c with `make`

After the build is successful, run the udp client which sends the controller's commands to the udp server (running on robot) as JSON with

```bash
./gamepad_interface -p 9020 -i 10.45.0.2
```

## Robot / Client

Insert the programmed SIM in the modem

Connect the Modem to the robot/client via usb

Install ModemManager and start it on Boot

```bash
sudo apt install modemmanager

sudo systemctl enable ModemManager
sudo systemctl start ModemManager
```

List Modems

```bash
sudo mmcli -L
```

Install Picocom

```bash
sudo apt install picocom
```

Identify AT Port

```bash
sudo mmcli -m 0 | grep ports
```

Start AT Console

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB2
```

- Check AT connection:

  ```
  AT
  ```

- Currently registered PLMN:

  ```
  AT+COPS?
  ```

- Returns the IMSI:

  ```
  AT+CIMI
  ```

- Returns APNs:
  ```
  AT+CGDCONT?
  ```

Example output:

```
+CGDCONT: 1,"IP","srsapn",...
+CGDCONT: 2,"IPV4V6","ims",...
+CGDCONT: 3,"IPV4V6","sos",...
```

> ⚠️ If you see multiple APNs (ims, sos), you'll get `DNN Not Supported OR Not Subscribed in the Slice` error in AMF logs. Remove extra APNs with:

```bash
AT+CGDCONT=2
AT+CGDCONT=3
```

Check the data interface

```bash
AT+QCFG="data_interface"
```

Set it to usb

```bash
AT+QCFG="data_interface",0,0
```

```bash
AT+QCFG="usbnet"

AT+QCFG="usbnet",2
```

Set APN with IPv4 Only

```bash
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","srsapn"
```

Attach to the Packet Domain

```bash
AT+CGATT=1
```

Activate PDP Context 1

```bash
AT+CGACT=1,1
```

Check if IP Address is Assigned

```bash
AT+CGPADDR=1
```

Ping Test

```bash
AT+QPING=1,"8.8.8.8"
```

Once the connection is successful and you see wwan0 as an interface,
You're all set to run the script in the robot folder on boot.
